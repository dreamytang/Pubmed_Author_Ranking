TI  - Association Between Cancer and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine in
      U.S. Chinese Women: Findings From the PINE Study.
PG  - 2333721418778199
LID - 10.1177/2333721418778199 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To examine U.S. Chinese older women and the association between their 
      cancer screening behaviors and self-reported cancers with Traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM) use across sociodemographic characteristics. Method: Through the
      Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE), 1,830 Chinese older women 
      self-reported history of cancer screening, presence of women's cancers, and TCM
      use according to type. Analyses were performed using multivariate regression
      models. Results: Chinese older women who underwent breast cancer screening are
      more likely to use herbal TCM (rate ratio [RR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval
      [CI] = [1.03, 1.29]), acupuncture (RR = 1.62, CI = [1.21, 2.15]), massage therapy
      (RR = 2.05, CI = [1.46, 2.88]), and tai chi (RR = 1.86, CI = [1.28, 2.69]). Those
      who had cervical cancer screening are more likely to use herbal TCM (RR = 1.32,
      CI = [1.17, 1.48]), acupuncture (RR = 1.66, CI = [1.27, 2.18]), massage therapy
      (RR = 1.61, CI = [1.17, 2.21]), tai chi (RR = 1.69, CI = [1.19, 2.40]), and other
      forms of TCM (RR = 1.36, CI = [1.04, 1.79]). Those with cervical cancer are less 
      likely to use herbal TCM (RR = 0.42, CI = [0.19, 0.93]). Conclusion: Contrary to 
      previous studies, our results suggest that U.S. Chinese older women who have
      engaged in cancer screening use TCM while those with self-reported cancer did not
      use TCM at a higher rate. This warrants further research on TCM utilization to
      identify reasons of use in this population and encourage patient-centered care.

TI  - SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF TRIGGER POINT DRY NEEDLING ON PAIN AND DISABILITY IN
      SUBJECTS WITH PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN SYNDROME.
PG  - 462-473
AB  - Background: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a prevalent knee disorder. A
      novel yet increasingly popular treatment for PFPS is trigger point dry needling
      (DN). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if DN is more effective
      at reducing pain and disability than a sham treatment in individuals with PFPS.
      Study design: Randomized trial. Materials/Methods: Sixty military health care
      beneficiaries (36 males) with a clinical diagnosis of PFPS were recruited and
      completed the study. Subjects underwent a standardized clinical examination and
      were randomized into a DN or sham treatment group. DN treatment consisted of
      insertion of an acupuncture-like needle into six sites in the quadriceps femoris 
      muscles of the symptomatic lower extremity based on a palpation examination. The 
      sham grouped received a simulated treatment with a sharp object and needle guide 
      tube without puncturing the skin. Self-reports of pain, disability, and overall
      status were collected before treatment, immediately after treatment and at 72
      hours. Data were analyzed with separate 2x2 repeated measures analysis of
      variance, with independent variables being Group (DN vs. sham) and Time
      (pre-treatment vs. immediately post-treatment, and pre-treatment vs. 72 hours).
      The hypothesis of interest in each case was the Group*Time interaction. The
      alpha-level was set a priori to .05 using 2-tailed tests. Results: Both groups
      exhibited a clinically meaningful reduction in pain based on numeric pain rating 
      scale scores immediately post-treatment and at 72 hours, but there was no
      statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.219, 0.310). There was
      no significant difference between groups for any other outcome measures.
      Conclusion: These data suggest that DN treatment is not more effective than a
      sham DN treatment at reducing short-term pain and disability in individuals with 
      PFPS when used as an isolated treatment approach. Level of Evidence: 2.

TI  - Effectiveness and feasibility of acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis: a pilot
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 269215518790632
LID - 10.1177/0269215518790632 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief and
      function improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis and to determine the
      feasibility of an eight-week acupuncture intervention. DESIGN: Pilot randomized
      controlled trial. SETTING: Three teaching hospitals in China. SUBJECTS: Patients 
      with knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren grade II or III). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      randomly assigned to an eight-week (three sessions per week) intervention of
      either traditional Chinese acupuncture or sham acupuncture. MAIN MEASURES: The
      primary outcome was response rate-the proportion of patients achieving score 36% 
      decrease in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC) pain and function at week 8 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes
      included pain, function and quality of life. RESULTS: Of 42 patients randomized, 
      36 (85.7%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in response
      rate between the traditional Chinese acupuncture and control groups: 61.9% (13 of
      21) versus 42.9% (9 of 21) achieved score 36% decrease in WOMAC pain and function
      at week 8 ( P = 0.217). The sum of WOMAC pain and function scores at week 8 was
      11.6 (9.1) in the traditional Chinese acupuncture group compared with 16.3 (10.9)
      in the control group ( P = 0.183). There was no significant difference between
      groups. Three adverse events were recorded and were classified as mild.
      CONCLUSION: It showed that three sessions per week acupuncture intervention of
      knee osteoarthritis was feasible and safe. No difference was observed between
      groups due to small sample size. Larger (sample size 296) randomized controlled
      trials of this intervention appear justified.

TI  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation at the Acupuncture Points on Relieve 
      Pain of Patients under Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Controlled Study.
LID - S2005-2901(17)30235-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jams.2018.06.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electrical stimulation and acupuncture points as
      non-pharmacological methods, have been the focus of pain reduction in different
      patients. This study is aimed at determining the effects of transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the acupuncture points of pain in patients
      under mechanical ventilators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double
      blind clinical trial study was conducted on 50 patients undergoing mechanical
      ventilation in intensive care units of ImamReza hospital in Kermanshah, Iran in
      2017. The patients were randomly allocated into intervention and placebo groups. 
      In the intervention group, TENS electrodes were placed on points Hegu and
      Zusanli. Pain severity was measured using the CPOT Scale, and the dosages of
      narcotics and sedation intake were recorded. Data were analyzed using the
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 19. RESULTS: 
      The level of pain in patients decreased in the intervention group in comparison
      with the sham group and this decline was significant during certain hours
      (P<0.05). The amount of used analgesic and sedation drugs was less significant in
      the intervention group compared to the sham group (P=0.01) (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: 
      The results showed that the use of TENS on Acupuncture Points can decrease the
      level of pain and opioid consumption in intubated patients under a mechanical
      ventilator.

AB  - Older adults disproportionately experience musculoskeletal symptoms, which are
      associated with morbidity and mortality. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an
      important part of Chinese culture and for millennia have been used to maintain
      health. This article aims to examine the association between musculoskeletal
      symptoms and different subtypes of TCM usage. Data were collected through the
      Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) study, a community-engaged,
      epidemiological study of a U.S. Chinese population. Review of systems was used to
      measure musculoskeletal symptoms. TCM use was measured by using a 5-point scale. 
      Logistic regression analyses were conducted to control for potential confounding 
      factors. Of 3,157 Chinese, older adults aged 60 and older, the mean age was 72.8 
      (SD = 8.3) and 58.9% were female. Older adults with any musculoskeletal symptoms 
      had greater utilization of overall TCM use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.10, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = [1.76, 2.52]), especially massage therapy (OR = 3.41, 
      95% CI = [2.51, 4.63]), herbal (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = [2.28, 3.14]), and
      acupuncture (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = [1.87, 3.32]). However, there was no
      statistically significant association between the presence of musculoskeletal
      symptoms and Tai-Chi (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = [0.93, 1.50]). This study demonstrated 
      that musculoskeletal symptoms among Chinese older adults were strongly associated
      with the use of TCM. Future research is needed to examine the effectiveness of
      TCM in treating musculoskeletal symptoms.

AB  - Objective: The development of obesity is inseparable from genetic and epigenetic 
      factors, and transcription factors (TFs) play an essential role in these two
      mechanisms. This review analyzes the interaction of TFs with epigenetic
      modifications and the epigenetic mechanisms underlying peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, an important transcription factor,
      in the development of obesity. Methods: We describe the relationship between TFs 
      and different epigenetic modifications and illustrate the several mechanisms
      described. Next, we summarize the epigenetic mechanisms of PPARs, an important
      class of transcription factors involved in obesity, that induce obesity with
      different triggering factors. Finally, we discuss the mechanisms of epigenetic
      modification of PPAR-related ligands in lipid metabolism and propose future
      avenues of research. Results: TFs participate in epigenetic modifications in
      different forms, causing changes in gene expression. The interactions between the
      different epigenetic modifications and PPARs are important biological
      developments that affect fat tissue differentiation, lipogenesis, and lipid
      metabolism, thereby inducing or inhibiting the development of obesity. We then
      highlight the need for more research to understand the role of epigenetic
      modifications and PPARs. Conclusions: Epigenetic mechanisms involved in the
      regulation of PPARs may be excellent therapeutic targets for obesity treatment.
      However, there is a need for a deeper understanding of how PPARs and other
      obesity-related transcription factors interact with epigenetic modifications.
